Developed a maximum power solar panel tracking system using an Arduino Nano, designed to optimize energy absorption by adjusting the panel's position to follow the sun. The system uses multiple LDR sensors to detect sunlight intensity and control servo motors to adjust the solar panel's angle for optimal alignment. This project improves the efficiency of solar energy collection by maximizing exposure throughout the day.
